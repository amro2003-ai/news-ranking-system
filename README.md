This project analyzes financial news with the aim of improving the decision-making process for investors. An LSTM model was built to classify news as positive or negative, and a ranking system was developed to process the latest news and rank the best stocks to invest in. A user interface was also created to interact with the model and display the top five most influential news items.

**Features:**

- **NLP:** An LSTM model was built to classify news as positive or negative.
- **Ranking News Pipeline:** A pipeline was developed to read data, analyze it, and provide the most impactful news.
